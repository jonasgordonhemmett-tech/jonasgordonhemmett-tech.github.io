I’m currently a Computer Science major at the University of Vermont. I love creative problem solving and exploring how technology can bring my ideas to life. I enjoy building projects that combine code, CAD, and hands-on experimentation to create practical and creative solutions

Outside of school, I always try to stay busy. I like skiing, leatherworking & fashion design, and playing games, whether they be video, card, or board.
